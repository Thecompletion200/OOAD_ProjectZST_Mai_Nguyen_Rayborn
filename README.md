Welcome to ZST!

Project by Steven Mai, Tyler Rayborn, Zach(Quan) Nguyen

High Level Overview: We’re trying to implement all of the patterns and concepts that we’ve learned so far in this class. For example: Singleton, Strategy, Inheritance, Encapsulation, etc… 
We are building a text-based adventure game (RPG) that will save a user’s state and store their game-related data in a text file so that they can pick up and play the game whenever they please.
